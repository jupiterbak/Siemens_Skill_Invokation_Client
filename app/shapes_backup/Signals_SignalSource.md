# Signal Source

When you donâ€™t want to route too many wires, how about trying `signal` elements.


A `signal` shape is an electrical design primitive. It is used to make an electrical 
connection between one schematic group and another group, or sheet symbol in a 
design. The name of the `signal` defines the connection. 

A `signal target` on a schematic sheet connects to `signals source`
or sheet entries with the **same name** in the project.
