# What is Markdown

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the 
document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating 
lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown 
is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

## Syntax guide
Hereâ€™s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use.

### Header
``` 
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
```

### Emphasis

```  
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
```

### Lists
