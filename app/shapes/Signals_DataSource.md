# Data Source

## Description
When you donâ€™t want to route too many wires, how about trying `data signal` elements.


A `data target` on a schematic sheet connects to `data source`
or sheet entries with the **same name** in the project.

(Optional) The value of `data source` can be forced to be constant.
