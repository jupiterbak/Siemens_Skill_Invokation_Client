# SWITCH Block

## Description
The **SWITCH** block gets a value and has five cases and the default case which can be configured. If a case has the same value as the input value then the case sends a HIGH signal. The default case can be configured to send a LOW or a HIGH signal if no other case gets triggered. The block has to be "activated" by applying a HIGH signal at the ctrl input.
