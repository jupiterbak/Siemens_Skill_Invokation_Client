# How to install it

I develop the project with `yarn` to build my webpack. 
YARN runs on Node.js, so if you don't have npm installed already, go ahead and install it.

### Install dependencies with npm

```
npm install
```

### Run the backend server
``` 
node ./app/backend/index.js
```

### Run the webpack builder in *dev* mode
open a second console and run

``` 
yarn dev
```
